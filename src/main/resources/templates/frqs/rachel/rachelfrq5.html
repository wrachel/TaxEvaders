<h2>FRQ5 Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Question 1 was fairly simple and made me write different methods for the class, which I was able to do. Similarly, Question 2 is similar to our PBL project, so I found completing the question fairly simple.
</p>
<p>
    Key takeaways: Understand Constructors & Overload Constructors, understand how to build a class (getters & setters), "this" keyword, static variables and methods
</p>
